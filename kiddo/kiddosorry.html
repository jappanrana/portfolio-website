        <h1>For My Love</h1>
        <p>
            My Kannaya, My Forever Love

My love, my heart, my precious bubu,
These days have been a storm I've spun.
I know I sulk, I cry, I fight,
Yet you hold me through each night.

I know you bend, I know you break,
Adjust, endure—for my own sake.
Through every tear, through every fight,
You love me still with endless might.

I know I make you worried so,
I rush, I push, yet still, you glow.
You take my storms, you take my rain,
And never once do you complain.

I see the love within your eyes,
A love so deep, it never dies.
Through love, through chaos, ever near.
And I know, beyond all time,
You'll be forever, wholly mine.

For restless nights that felt so long.
For memories we planned but couldn’t make,
For moments lost, for worries deep,
For moments lost that passed us by,
I’m sorry, my kanna, for what I do,
For making hard days harder too.

Yet even then, you stay, you stand,
You hold my heart within your hand.
With every flaw, you choose to see,
Not burden—but love, endlessly.

never once did anger rise,
Only warmth within your eyes.
Through sacrifice and every test,
You always give me all your best.

A year has passed, yet more will come,
And still, our love won’t be undone.
With every sunrise, every sun.
Through time and tide, through joy and ache,
Our love will stand, forever as it will be.

For what we share is pure, divine,
A bond no force could redefine.
Not just in words, not just in vow,
But in the way you love me now.

Oh, how grateful I am for you,
For love so strong, so kind, so true.
Hanuman Ji must love me so,
To send his most cherished child to me to glow.


You are my home, my peace, my light,
My perfect love, my soul's delight.
I’m grateful, proud, and so in awe,
Of us, of you—just as you are.

So thank you, my baby, for all you do,
For loving me, for being you.
For holding me when times feel rough,
For making ‘us’ more than enough.
